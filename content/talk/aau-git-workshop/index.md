When you work on a large group project, it can be advantageous to keep track of changes with a _version control system_.
Git is the most widespread of such systems, and web platforms like GitHub make it easy to overview and collaborate.
With Git and GitHub not only do you have a complete backup of your project and its history, but you have a structured way to access old versions of files, reviwing changes before applying them, and much, much more.

This workshop will aim to:

- show you the idea behind version control
- teach you basic Git commands
- introduce you to a Git-based workflow for project writing
- get your own project repositories set up and ready
