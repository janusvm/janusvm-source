LaTeX is a typesetting system which is widely used in academia, and on AAU, you are expected to use it.
This compilation based way of writing offers many advantages over WYSIWYG editors like MS Word, such as cross-platform compatibility, editor agnosticism, extensibility, and version control friendly format.

This workshop will aim to:

* show you a bit about _how_ LaTeX works
* show you how to structure a group project
* prepare you for the upcoming semester project with a project template
