Metaprogramming is when a computer program has the ability to treat programs as their data, enabling them to read or generate code, or even modify itself while running.
It's a technique that became popular with the programming language Lisp, from which R inherits many ideas.

In this talk, I dive into the inner workings of R and look at how the code you write is represented by the interpreter, give an overview of the tools available in the package [rlang](https://github.com/r-lib/rlang), and show off some common usecases in a [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) framework.
