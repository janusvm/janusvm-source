This minicourse in databases and SQL is part of Computational Statistics and Operations Research, a course held in the spring semester of 2019 at Aalborg University for 2nd semester Operations Research master students.

The goal of the course is not to be a comprehensive course in SQL, but rather to teach the student enough of the basics to enable them to use SQL databases as part of their data analysis pipeline, in particular via the programming language R.
