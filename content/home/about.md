# About Me

I am a 26-year-old PhD student at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.aau.dk/) of Aalborg University.
My academic interests lie within the fields of probability theory and statistics, and in particular I study the theory of copulas.

Aside from that, I like [drawing comics](https://tapas.io/series/Treehouse) and [programming](https://github.com/janusvm).
